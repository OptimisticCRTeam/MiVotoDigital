## Project Overview ðŸ‘¾

This project is a blockchain-based game developed on the Optivision blockchain. It integrates various features to provide an engaging and interactive experience. Characters in the game are minted as NFTs using the ERC721 standard, allowing players to own, trade, and battle with their digital assets.

## Technologies Used âš™

- **Optimism Blockchain**: Optimism is an extension to Ethereum which enables users and developers to benefit from the latterâ€™s strong security guarantees while being cheaper and faster. 
- **Solidity**: Programming language used to write the smart contracts for the game.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing Solidity smart contracts.
- **JavaScript**: Used with Hardhat for scripting and deployment tasks.

## Features âœ…

- **ERC721 NFTs**: Characters are represented as unique.
- **Battles**: Engage in battles with other players' NFTs.
- **On-Chain Data**: All game logic and state are managed directly on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Future Goals ðŸŽ¯

As we continue to develop and enhance our on-chain game, we have several exciting goals for the future:

### 1. User-Friendly Web Interface

We aim to build a comprehensive web page with a user-friendly interface that will make interacting with the game more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. This interface will provide players with an intuitive way to:

- **Mint and Manage NFTs**: Easily create, view, and manage their character NFTs.
- **Engage in Battles**: Access and participate in battles through a seamless and interactive UI.
- **Navigate the Marketplace**: Browse and transact on the marketplace with a straightforward, visually appealing design.

### 2. Character Marketplace

A key goal is to develop an integrated marketplace where players can buy, sell, and trade their character NFTs. This marketplace will feature:

- **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Tools to help users find specific characters or categories.
- **Secure Transactions**: Robust mechanisms to ensure safe and transparent exchanges.
- **Price Analytics**: Insights into market trends and character valuations to inform buying and selling decisions.

### 3. Enhanced Game Functionality

We plan to continually expand the game's features to enhance the overall player experience. Future updates may include:

- **New Game Modes**: Introducing diverse game modes and challenges to keep gameplay fresh and engaging.
- **Customizable Characters**: Allowing players to personalize their NFTs with unique attributes or abilities.
- **Community Features**: Adding social elements such as leaderboards, achievements, and player interactions to foster a vibrant gaming community.

We are excited about these future developments and believe they will significantly enrich the gaming experience. Stay tuned for updates as we work towards these goals!

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```-->
